# Demo

Welcome to HubBub's landing page! :wave: <br />
:soon: Full authorization, and user onboarding flow for new accounts.

![Demo of Login](https://hubbub-demo.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2021-01-20+15.17.32.gif)

Once logged in, the user will see their selected interests, and can easily toggle which interests they'd like to follow.

By clicking on an interest, the user will navigate to the interest's hub page for their city, featuring a message board. <br />
On the Seattle Gaming hub, users are discussing a variety of topics! :video_game: <br />
From a forum topic, it's easy for the user to navigate back to the main interest hub page. <br />
:soon: Additional widgets on the interest hub page.

Here, a user adds a new topic to the message board! Be sure to populate both the title and text ;) <br />
When the modal is active, an overlay prevents the user from interacting with other elements on the page. Clicking anywhere outside the modal will cause the modal to close. <br />
The message board features automatic pagination. :tada: <br />

And here's a user adding their very thoughtful reply to a topic. <br />
This modal behaves just like the 'new topic' modal. <br />
:soon: Functionality for 'watching' topics, and for users to edit and delete their posts.

When the user is ready to leave, logging out is simple and intuitive, via a handy dropdown menu. <br />
:soon: Functionality for users to edit settings, and to create and edit a public-facing profile.
